# paceR

![ACG Costa Rica](ACG.jpg)

`paceR` is a collection of functions that make it easy to get data from the University of Calgary's PACE Database into R for further analysis.

To use the tools, you must have access to the PACE Database. If you don't know how to do this, you can ask [Fernando](mailto:facampos@ucalgary.ca), [Urs](mailto:urs.kalbitzer@ucalgary.ca), or [John](mailto:jaddicot@ucalgary.ca).


## Preparation

To use this package, you first need to install `devtools` with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("devtools")
```

Then, you can install the latest development version of `paceR` from github:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
  library(devtools)
  devtools::install_github("camposfa/paceR")
```

After you have installed the package once, you can simply load it in the future using:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE} 
  library(paceR)
```

This package makes heavy use of the data manipulation packages [stringr](http://cran.r-project.org/package=stringr), [lubridate](http://cran.r-project.org/package=lubridate), [tidyr](http://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyr), and [dplyr](http://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr). If not already installed, `paceR` will install these packages automatically. It also provides a convenient function to load them all into your R session, if you want to use them for other tasks:

```{r, message = FALSE}
  load_pace_packages()
```


## Connecting to the PACE Database

To get data from PACE, you must create an SSH tunnel. If you have set up your SSH key, you can do it like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
system('ssh -f camposf@pacelab.ucalgary.ca -L 3307:localhost:3306 -N')
```

With the tunnel created, we can now connect to the database(s). The primary database is called `monkey`. There is also a secondary database called `paceR` that has a variety of convenient views that are designed to be used with this package. We'll create connections to both.

```{r}
  # Connect to monkey database
  pace_db <- src_mysql(group = "PACE", user = "camposf", dbname = "monkey", password = NULL)
  
  # Connect to paceR database  
  paceR_db <- src_mysql(group = "PACE", user = "camposf", dbname = "paceR", password = NULL)
```

It should go without saying, but the above lines are just an example--if copied verbatim, they will **not** work for anyone but me (Fernando). You must first set up the SSH key and then modify these lines for your particular account.


## Getting data from the database

Once you get the connection worked out, you now can pull data from the database. Whenever you download data, you must pass the name of the database connection that you're using. To do this correctly, it is crucial that you understand a major design decision that affects how the functions can be used.


### Downloading data using saved views (RECOMMENDED METHOD!)

The best way to get data from the database is to use the convenient saved "views". These are stored in the `paceR` database, and they should be called using the functions that begin with `getv_`

```{r}
# Get a Individuals data
(i2 <- getv_Individual(paceR_db))

# Get a condensed version
(i2 <- getv_Individual(paceR_db, full = FALSE))
```


### Downloading raw database tables (NOT RECOMMENDED!)

If you want to download __raw database tables__, then you should use function `get_pace_tbl()`. All tables are stored in the `monkey` database, and so when you use this function, you must pass the connection to the `monkey` database in addition to the name of the table that you want to download. For example:

```{r}
# Get the raw individuals table
(i <- get_pace_tbl(pace_db, "tblIndividual"))

# Get the raw deaths table
(d <- get_pace_tbl(pace_db, "tblIndividualDeath"))
```

Note that the "foreign keys" (i.e., the columns that end with "ID") are just uninformative numbers! To make use of the data, you might need to join the tables by their ID relevant fields.

```{r}
# Join the individuals and deaths tables
id <- left_join(i, d, by = c("ID" = "IndividualID"))
```

You can see that there are many more ID fields that would need to be joined. It can very inconvenient to work with the data this way!
